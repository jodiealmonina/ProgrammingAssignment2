## Write a short comment describing this function
makeCacheMatrix function basically makes a special "matrix" object that can
store its inverse for the data
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
inv <- NULL
set <- function(y) {
x <<- y
inv <<- NULL
}
get <- function() x
setInverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
getInverse <- function() inv
list(set = set,get = get,setInverse = setInverse,getInverse = getInverse)
}


## Write a short comment describing this function
cacheSolve is a function that register the inverse of the special "matrix" restored by makeCacheMatrix. On the off chance that the inverse has been computed, at that point the cacheSolve ought to recover the inverse out of the cache
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
inv <- x$getInverse()
if (!is.null(inv)) {
message("getting cached data")
return(inv)}
mat <- x$get()
inv <- solve(mat, ...)
x$setInverse(inv)
inv}
